# Smart Mirror Project
I am using a raspberry pi model to make a Smart Mirror that displays useful things for my everyday life! The monitor is going to run a program that I wrote from scratch, using react and electron and display the information on the mirror. I am going to put the following modules on the mirror: date/time, to do list, music, photo album slide show, text notifications.

# Display Sketch 
While waiting for my software to download, I decided to made a sketch of the monitor display and layout of my additions. My initial design (the one on top) was much more cramped, with everything on one side. But after realizing that the monitor is only 7 inches, I changed the sketch (bottom) to be more spread out and have all the icons larger. Another thing that I changed between the two drafts is the color scheme. In my final draft I kept the color scheme more simple, pink on the right and green on the left, which is much more aesthetic than my first attempt.
